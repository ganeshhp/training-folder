## write a workflow to build, test and deploy a Java project with different types of triggers

1) open the file javaproject-workflow.yml under .github/workflows folder.
2) Update the existing code with lines of below code.


name: Java Maven CI/CD Pipeline (Matrix)
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - master
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  build-test-deploy:
    name: Build & Test on Java ${{ matrix.java }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        java: [8, 11, 17, 18]

    steps:
      # Step 1: Checkout source code
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Set up Java (Matrix-driven)
      - name: Set up JDK ${{ matrix.java }}
        uses: actions/setup-java@v4
        with:
          distribution: temurin
          java-version: ${{ matrix.java }}
          cache: maven

      # Step 3: Build & Test
      - name: Build and Test with Maven
        run: mvn clean test

      # Step 4: Package application
      - name: Package application
        run: mvn clean package -DskipTests

      # Step 5: Upload artifact (only once, not for every Java version)
      - name: Upload build artifact
        if: matrix.java == '8'
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: helloworldweb-war
          path: target/*.war

## observer the strategy and fail-fast statements. the fail-fast with false value does make sure to continue with the build even if the first fails.
## if statement in step5 makes sure that only package artifact for Java 8 version will be uploaded and not others.
