## We will use prebuild GitHub action. The actions are available at github.com under actions repository. ## @"https://github.com/actions/checkout"

1. create a new workflow file under ./github/workflows as action-workflow.yml

name: Checkout Demo
on: 
  push
jobs:
  checkout:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: ls -la

2. Save the file, commit the changes to the local repository and push the changes to the remote repository on GitHub.
3. observe the automated workflow execution.
