## write a workflow to build, test and deploy a Java project

1) open the file javaproject-workflow.yml under .github/workflows folder.
2) Update the existing code with lines of below code.

name: Java Maven CI/CD Pipeline*
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  build-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # Step 1: Checkout source code
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      # Step 2: Set up Java
      - name: Set up JDK 8
        uses: actions/setup-java@v4
        with:
          distribution: temurin
          java-version: '8'
          cache: maven
      # Step 3: Build and test using Maven
      - name: run the step only if branch name is main
        if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
        run: mvn clean test

  package-deploy:
    needs: build-test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # step 1: Test using Maven
      - name: package the application
        run: mvn clean package -DskipTests
      # Step 2: Upload build artifact (Deploy stage example)
      - name: Upload build artifact
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: helloworldweb-artifact
          path: target/*.war

3) save the file, commit the changes to the local repository and push the changes to the GitHub remote repository. 

4) Observe the workflow execution as the steps in the workflow implements the Maven build stages added with dependencies of Jobs. The 'package-deploy' job would run only on successful completion of the first job 'build-test'.
